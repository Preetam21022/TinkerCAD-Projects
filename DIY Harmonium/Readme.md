# DIY Harmonium

This project recreates a simple 13-key harmonium using Arduino Uno, pushbuttons, and a piezo buzzer. Each button corresponds to one musical note from an octave, including both shuddha (natural), komal (flat), and kori (sharp) swaras based on Indian classical music.

## ðŸ§° Components Used

| Component     | Quantity | Description                     |
|--------------|----------|---------------------------------|
| Arduino Uno  | 1        | Microcontroller                 |
| Pushbuttons  | 13       | One for each note               |
| Piezo Buzzer | 1        | To produce sound                |
| Resistors    | 13       | 220â„¦ pull-down resistors        |
| Breadboard   | 1        | For assembling the circuit      |
| Jumper Wires | Several  | For connections                 |

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit Connections

- Each pushbutton is connected to a digital/analog pin (A4, A5, 2â€“12).
- The other side of each button goes to GND through a resistor.
- The piezo buzzer is connected to pin 13 (`bP` in code).
- All components share a common GND.

## ðŸŽ¶ How It Works

- When a button is pressed, it triggers a tone using the `tone()` function.
- The pitch of the tone is matched to the corresponding musical note.
- Each note's frequency is defined using a `struct Note` array.

## ðŸ§­ Real-Life Applications

- Teaching basic music theory and swaras
- Digital harmonium or synth learning tool
- Embedded sound project experiments
- Fun DIY musical instrument for kids and beginners

## ðŸ”§ Future Upgrades I Will Work On

- Iâ€™ll add **octave selection** using an extra button to switch between high and low tones.
- I plan to include an **LCD screen** to show the name of the note being played.
- I may use **velocity-sensitive input (pressure-based)** for advanced dynamics.
- I will try recording and replaying note sequences using Arduino memory.
